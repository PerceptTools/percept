Building Percept
================

(thanks to github/NaluCFD for examples of this build process)

First, have a look at the .sh files in this director and modify as necessary.

Some steps are manual, see each of thse files.

0. you will need an MPI installation, such as OpenMPI: https://www.open-mpi.org, and a Cmake installation, https://cmake.org
If you don't already have these in your path, download, configure and build OpenMPI and Cmake first, then do the following:

1. module-file - sets this directory path, and paths to MPI and gcc - edit it as necessary

2. setup.sh - run this to setup directories

3. get-tpls.sh - gets third-party libraries from net

4. build-tpls.sh - run after get-tpls.sh

The following two steps are manual:

5. see sample-trilinos-release.config - it is copied to
./packages/Trilinos/build - edit it as needed then execute it in that
directory followed by

   make
   make install

6. copy sample-percept-release.config to a non-tracked file in this
directory,  edit and then execute it, followed by make to build
percept_*test and mesh_adapt. NOTE: to build only the "lite" version of
percept's library (e.g. for use by Nalu), use the
sample-percept-lite-release.config file as a starting point - the lite
version doesn't use OpenNURBS or Intrepid and results in a smaller
executable, but with less functionality.
